# Kindle Archivus: Personal Epub Collection Curation Tool

## Tool for personal curation of epub collection stored in Google Sheets using data from GoodReads

This project aims to help in curating my current and future epub files for my Kindle. The problem I am trying to solve is the manual data entry of the book details (title, author, etc.) obtained from goodreads. Instead of manually typing the details of each book, I am to automate the process by scraping the data directly from goodreads. 
I also aim to create a sustainable platform for interacting with my epub collection catalog for curation and reference.

## Book details extracted from Goodreads
* Book title
* Author
* Average goodreads rating
* Number of ratings
* Book description
* Category/ genre tags
* Publication date

## Target Fundamental Features for Mk 1
* Add a new book (with complete details)
* Search and sort according to the following criteria
    - Book title
    - Author
    - Primary and/or Secondary category
